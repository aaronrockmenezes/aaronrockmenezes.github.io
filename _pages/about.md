Hello, I'm Aaron!

I'm a 4th-year MSc. Biological Sciences + B.Eng. Electronics & Instrumentation student at BITS Pilani, Goa with a minor in Data Science in Climate & Health. As an undergrad and an ML researcher, I'm deeply involved in projects at the intersection of biology, electronics, and artificial intelligence. 

Currently, I'm working on predicting location-specific RNA-protein interactions with <a href='https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/raviprasad-aduri/'>Prof. Raviprasad Aduri</a> and contributing to a drug discovery project at <a href='https://appcair.com/'>APPCAIR</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin-srinivasan/'>Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan</a>. I'm also an intern at <a href='https://deepforestsci.com/'>Deep Forest Sciences</a>, wherein I work on improving Computer Vision. On the open source side, I'm an active contribuot to <a href='https://deepchem.io/'>DeepChem</a>, a Python aimed at scientific machine learning. I've been developing and applying my skills to tackle real-world challenges in science and technology and have taken a recent interested in Federated Learning.

Aside from work, I'm a huge fan of the outdoors, and I love to explore new places. I'm also a big fan of music (any Post Malone or Weeknd fans?) and video games, Elden Ring being my most recent buy. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to chat!
